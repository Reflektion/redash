# For the existing Demo instance 
For the existing Demo instance which is being used as of August 2017 : http://dev-east-rfk-data-nlp-demo-01-c01.dev.rfksrv.com:8080/
The 'container build' process (installing libraries and pulling images) are already done.

In case the Docker-containers go down or need to be restarted:

1. 

> cd ~/redash/
> sudo docker-compose create
> sudo docker-compose start
> sudo docker-compose up

Leave this process running (we can use screens for remote ssh). We can see the logs in the terminal as well

2. In a separate process

> cd ~/redash/
> sudo bash run.sh

Again, leave this process running. This creates the front-end at port 8080

3.
Now, give a dummy username/passwd to login at : http://dev-east-rfk-data-nlp-demo-01-c01.dev.rfksrv.com:8080/

Use the UI and the front end to 
- Connect to the Datasource / MySQL runnng inside the instance:

Local IP address (the IP needs be given, 'localhost' does not work): 10.20.8.81 
[ If there is a new instance - do an ifconfig to get the local IP address.]
Username: reflektion
Password: password1

- Execute/Save any of our hardcoded sample queries
- Add to dashboard. Make it presentable etc..

# List of predefined / hard coded queries for Demo

The map exists in ~/redash/redash/handlers/query_results.py

"show me numbers of millennials who showed interest in auto and rental insurances in last month"
"show me numbers of millennials who showed interest in home insurances in last month"
"show me numbers of 40 year and above looking to purchase umbrella insurance"
"how many usaa families are not engaging in email marketing campaign across california region in 2016"
"how many usaa families are engaging in monthly email marketing campaign across california region in 2016"
"which newsletter getting highest engagements in 2016"
"show me usaa families who has purchased small business insurance across texas"
"transaction volume of renewal transactions in 2016 across states"
"how many requests for auto loan came through last year search engine marketing campaigns?"
"show number of transactions for each product"
"get number of transactions for Auto Insurance and Rental Insurance grouped by month"
"show me number of transactions for each state as a map"

# New Instance Setup

For a new instance the process is the same. What is required is the initial setup which includes
- Building the containers .  and
- Creating a local DB server to act as a datasource: This can be done in any standard way: install MySQL, create tables etc:
  As mentioned earlier, use ifconfig to get the local IP
  Use IP/usernmae/passwd to add datasource.
  

## Now How to build containers and setup  ...

> cd <redash-home-dir>
> sudo docker-compose build

You might face some errors. TODO
