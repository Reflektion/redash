# For the existing Demo instance 
For the existing Demo instance which is being used as of August 2017 : http://dev-east-rfk-data-nlp-demo-01-c01.dev.rfksrv.com:8080/
The 'container build' process (installing libraries and pulling images) are already done.

In case the Docker-containers go down or need to be restarted:

1. 

> cd ~/redash/
> sudo docker-compose create
> sudo docker-compose start
> sudo docker-compose up

Leave this process running (we can use screens for remote ssh). We can see the logs in the terminal as well

2. In a separate process

> cd ~/redash/
> sudo bash run.sh

Again, leave this process running. This creates the front-end at port 8080

3.
Now, give a dummy username/passwd to login at : http://dev-east-rfk-data-nlp-demo-01-c01.dev.rfksrv.com:8080/

Use the UI and the front end to 
- Connect to the Datasource / MySQL runnng inside the instance:

Local IP address (this needs be given, 'localhost' does not work): 10.20.8.81 
If there is a new instance - do an ifconfig to get the local IP address.

- Execute/Save any of our hardcoded sample queries
- Add to dashboard. Make it presentable etc..
